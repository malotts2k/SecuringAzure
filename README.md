# Securing Azure: The Checklist
<br>
<br>

<h2>Strategy:</h2>

ðŸ’¡ Understand the shared responsibility model and the chosen cloud strategy - clear delineation between our responsibility and the customer's.

<h2>**Identities and Access Management:**</h2>

âœ” Manage identities using Azure Active Directory. Enable SSO to alleviate potential issues revolving around weak passwords.

âœ” Minimize the number of subscription owners. No more than three (two for managing and one backup account).

âœ” Azure Key Vault should be used for cryptographic keys, secrets, and certificates.

<h2>**Security and Endpoint Protection:**</h2>

âœ” Azure Security Center utilization is a must; understand alerts, the secure score, and follow suggestions where appropriate. If hybrid, use Azure Defender.

âœ” Keep VMs updated. Azure Security Center should be the default method to automate security updates.

âœ” Restrict remote access to your VMs and use VPNs where applicable. Just In Time access reduces brute force attack exposure.

âœ” Enable OS vulnerabilties recommendations - this setting provides analysis of OS-level configurations to seek out issues that often make VMs vulnerable to attacks.

âœ” Enabling endpoint protection allows Azure Security Center to push endpoint protection for provisioning of all Windows VMs and helps identify malicious software.

<h2>**Networks and Encryption:**</h2>

âœ” Network access must have a layered approach:

  * Azure firewall or a 3rd party virtual network appliance
  
  *  Use Network Security Groups (NSGs) for traffic filtering to and from Azure virtual networks
  
  * Apply NSGs to VM NICs to regulate traffic to and from virtual machines
  
âœ” Enable encryption for data in transit and at rest where authorized.
